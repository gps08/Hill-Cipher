# Hill-Cipher
This is a simple hill cipher implementation in C++

The program is pretty much self explanatory when running.
It can process any type of text file and replaces the contents of the file with encrypted code.

This was written for g++ 4.9.2 (Linux) and may be modified for compilation in windows.

The key matrix can be modified for totally secure encryption.
